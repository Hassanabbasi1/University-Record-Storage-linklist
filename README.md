# University-Record-Storage-linklist

Arrays are used to store sets of data of similar data types at contiguous memory locations. Unlike Arrays, Structures are user-defined data types that are used to store groups of items of non-similar data types. Here, we are going to compile a C++ program that will store the information of all the universty records.

here in this C++ program we have used functions of the linklist in the case system which makes it easier to understand and compile  there are multiple functions used ISERT, SEARCH, DISPLAY, DELETE.
